# ðŸš€ Day 12 of 111 Days of Learning for Change

## ðŸ“… Date: April 25, 2025

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered:
Today, I explored **CSS Display, Positioning, and Float** â€” essential tools for structuring and laying out web content effectively.

### âœ… What I Learned:

- ### `display` property:
  - `block`: takes full width
  - `inline`: takes only the content width
  - `inline-block`: inline + block behavior
  - `none`: hides the element

- ### CSS `position` property:
  - `static`: default flow of the page
  - `relative`: positioned relative to its normal spot
  - `absolute`: positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
  - `fixed`: positioned relative to the viewport
  - `sticky`: toggles between relative and fixed based on scroll

- ### Other properties:
  - `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`: for positioning control
  - `z-index`: for stacking layered elements

- ### Float and Clear:
  - `float`: moves an element to the left or right
  - `clear`: stops elements from wrapping around floated elements

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:
- Positioning elements properly is crucial for modern layouts.
- Floating is an older method but still important to understand.
- `z-index` helps in managing overlapping content.

## ðŸ›  Practice:
- Created small examples demonstrating each property.
- Tested combinations of positioning with float and z-index.
- Noticed how `sticky` behaves differently with scrolling containers.
