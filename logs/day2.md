### ✅ Topics Covered:
- Displaying images using the `<img>` tag
- Embedding audio using `<audio controls>`
- Inserting video through `<iframe>`
- Linking to another HTML page using `<a href>`

## 🧠 Reflections

It was really exciting to see how just a few lines of code can bring a webpage to life with media elements. Multimedia adds a whole new level of interactivity to web development.  

Big thanks to **Apna College** for the structured content and to **Hissee Maharjan** for teaming up on this journey. Onward to more learning!
