📅 **Topic:** Backgrounds, Borders & Gradients in CSS

### 🎯 What I covered:
- `background-color`, `background-image`, `background-size`, `background-repeat` for styling backgrounds
- `border`, `border-radius`, and `border-style` to define and customize borders
- `box-shadow` for adding clean and soft shadows to elements
- Explored gradients using:  
  - `linear-gradient`  
  - `radial-gradient`

### 🔍 Hands-on practice:
- Tried different combinations of background images and gradients
- Customized borders with various styles and radii
- Created glowing button effects with `box-shadow`

### 💬 Reflection:
- These styles really take a webpage from basic to beautiful
- Excited to play more with gradients and shadows in my future projects!
