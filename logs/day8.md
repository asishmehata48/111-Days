## 🛠️ Practice: Styling My HTML Portfolio

To kick off my CSS learning, I began styling the HTML-only portfolio I built last week. I focused on:

- 🎨 Adding color using HEX, RGB, and HSL  
- 🧩 Structuring with class and ID selectors  
- 🧼 Using CSS comments for clean code  
- 🧷 Grouping selectors to avoid repetition  

This hands-on styling made me appreciate how CSS brings life and personality to a webpage.
