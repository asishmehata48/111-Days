## 🛠️ Project: HTML-Only Portfolio

Today, I applied all the concepts from this week's HTML learning to build a personal portfolio website. It includes:

- 👤 About Me section  
- 🛠️ Skills list  
- 📊 Projects table with links  
- ✉️ Contact form with validation

The project is fully built using **only HTML**, showcasing my understanding of structure, layout, and interactive elements like forms and navigation.

## 🧠 Reflections:
Consistency, dedication and Obsession will make you.
Wrapping up HTML week has been exciting and confidence-boosting! I now have a solid foundation in structuring web content.

Next week, I’ll dive into **CSS** to enhance my portfolio's design and styling. Can't wait to bring it to life visually!
