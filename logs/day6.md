Today I focused on improving my HTML skills and learned the following:

## âœ… What I Learned

- Used **semantic tags** to make HTML structure more meaningful and accessible.
- Learned how to use `colspan` and `rowspan` in HTML tables.
- Explored various aspects of **HTML forms**:
  - Understood how the `action` attribute works during form submission.
  - Played with different `input` types (`text`, `password`, `radio`, `checkbox`, etc.)
  - Connected `label` tags properly with form inputs.
  - Used `select` tag to create dropdown menus.
  - Used `textarea` for collecting feedback from users.

- Learned the difference and use cases of `class` and `id` attributes in HTML.
