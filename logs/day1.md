# Day 1 Completed

# Experience
This is the day 1 of the challenge and i was planning of diving deep into Javascript which would be a great idea
but wasn't the best. I also did some of the research on what should i do in next 111 days and found some of the 
resources as well but i found a mate that helped me to plan some of the things that should be done to be a web
developer, as i'm in this current level, i don't mastered CSS, so i thought of going on the plan of the Mate. 
Huge Kudos to you Mate!

# Learning
Main thing that i learned was teamwork is the best thing you can do, like i was working alone and my fellow mate aka 
** Eena **, we had a meet and she helped me to do the work like what should we post, what should we write in it and what type of caption should we use in the post, and it was super cool and it was great experience to talk to someone random and be frank like that.
We can do a work alone but team makes it even Better.
