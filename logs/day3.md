🚀 **Day 3 of** #111DaysOfLearningForChange **organized by Code for Change Kathmandu.**  
Today’s focus was on mastering basic HTML formatting tags and structuring content on a webpage. 🙌

💡 **What I learned:**  
✅ Used `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<br>`, and `<hr>` for text formatting and visual separation  
✅ Practiced `<big>`, `<small>`, `<sub>`, `<sup>`, and `<pre>` for adjusting size, notation, and preformatted text

🎬 It’s exciting how simple HTML tags can organize and style content! I’m building a solid foundation for web development. 

🔍 **Reflection:**  
Understanding these basic tags makes me more confident in structuring content. Each day is pushing me further!

👥 Teaming up with **Hissee Maharjan** for this journey makes every day more motivating. Let’s keep going strong!
