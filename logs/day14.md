# Day 14: CSS Grid and Responsive Design

## Learning Overview
Today, I focused on **CSS Grid** and **responsive design** using media queries. I learned how to create layouts with `display: grid`, `grid-template-columns`, and `grid-template-rows`. I also practiced adding **gaps** between grid items and used **`@media` queries** to make the design responsive.

## Key Concepts Covered:
- **CSS Grid Layout**:
  - `display: grid` to create a grid container.
  - `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` to define the structure.
  - Using `gap` to add spacing between grid items.
  
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Using `@media` queries to adjust layout for different screen sizes.

- **Image Gallery**:
  - Added three images in a row inside the profile section using CSS Grid.
  - Ensured the images are responsive and adjust automatically to screen size.

## Challenges & Solutions:
- **Challenge**: Aligning multiple images side by side using CSS Grid.
- **Solution**: Used `grid-template-columns` to divide the space into 3 equal columns and ensured the images are responsive with `width: 100%`.

## Next Steps:
- Continue experimenting with CSS Grid and try adding more advanced layouts.
- Focus on mobile-first design in upcoming days.
