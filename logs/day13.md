## Reflection:
Today, I delved into **CSS Flexbox** and its role in creating flexible and responsive layouts.  
Flexbox is essential for web development because it makes aligning elements on the page much easier and more dynamic, especially for mobile-first design.  
By practicing Flexbox properties, I was able to build a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

Looking forward to using this knowledge to improve layout designs in future projects! ðŸš€
