Today, I explored the core building blocks of decision-making in JavaScript — control structures that help programs react dynamically to user input and conditions!

---

## ✅ Covered Topics:
- `if`, `else if`, `else` statements
- `switch` statement
- Ternary operator (`condition ? value1 : value2`)

---

## 🛠️ Practice Summary:
I implemented conditional logic in different scenarios to enhance my understanding of how JavaScript controls program flow. These concepts are crucial for building responsive and interactive web applications.

---

## 📈 Reflection:
Each condition I write sharpens my logical thinking and brings me closer to becoming a proficient web developer!
