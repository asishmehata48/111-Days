## Topic: GitHub Foundations Part 2

Today, I completed four important modules in GitHub Foundations Part 2:

- **Authenticate and authorize user identities on GitHub**  
- **Manage repository changes by using pull requests on GitHub**  
- **Search and organize repository history by using GitHub**  
- **Using GitHub Copilot with Python**

These modules helped me deepen my understanding of GitHub collaboration workflows, user security, and coding productivity tools.
