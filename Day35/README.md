# Day 35: GitHub Foundations - Introduction to Git & GitHub

## Summary
Today, I completed the first two modules of the GitHub Foundations learning path on Microsoft Learn:

- **Introduction to GitHub**

I gained a solid understanding of version control concepts and how GitHub enables developers to collaborate efficiently on code projects. This foundation will help me improve my workflow, contribute to open-source projects, and work better in teams.
