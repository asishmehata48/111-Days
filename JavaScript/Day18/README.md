**What I Learned Today: JavaScript Functions**

- Function declaration and calling  
- Functions with parameters and return values  
- Arrow functions `()=>{}` for concise syntax

Understanding JavaScript functions is a key step towards writing cleaner, reusable, and more organized code, which will be essential as I move forward in both frontend and backend development. ðŸš€

#Reflection
Today, I grasped the power of functions in JavaScript. The ability to declare, call, and return values from functions will allow me to break down complex tasks into simpler, manageable parts. Arrow functions, in particular, offer a cleaner syntax, making the code even more efficient and readable. This newfound understanding will certainly help in optimizing my projects and improving code structure.
