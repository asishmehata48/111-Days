  - `console.log()` â€“ Debug and view output in the console

### ðŸ§  Reflection:
Practiced writing simple interactive programs using operators and user input methods. Gained confidence in evaluating expressions and understanding how logic flows in a JavaScript program.

### ðŸ“ˆ Progress:
One step closer to becoming a proficient Web Developer!
