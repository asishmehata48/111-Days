## 📌 Why I'm Revisiting HTML

You might be wondering — *“Why is this guy learning HTML? Doesn’t he already know it?”*  
Well, yes — I do. But it's been quite a while since I last used it, and back then, I only scratched the surface.

Previously, I approached HTML as a **Literalist** — focusing solely on syntax without truly understanding the underlying concepts and structure. This time, I'm taking a **conceptual and structured approach**, diving deeper into the *"why"* behind the tags and how everything fits together.

My goal is to rebuild a strong foundation by learning HTML sequentially, with a focus on both **clarity and depth**.
