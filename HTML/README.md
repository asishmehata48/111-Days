# Why this?
You'll be wandering why is this guy learning HTML, didn't he know it, Yes I do but its been a long time since i used it and i want to learn it more concept wise, last time when i learned it, i was a Literalist. I just learned on a surface level not the deep and core concept of HTML. So I want to Learn sequencially.
