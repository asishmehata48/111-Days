## 📌 About the Challenge

**111 Days of Learning** is an initiative by Code for Change Kathmandu that encourages consistency, self-growth, and community learning. The challenge is structured to help participants level up their skills in any domain they choose, through daily learning and sharing progress.

I have chosen to focus on **Web Development** – diving deep into JavaScript, DOM, APIs, frameworks, and building real-world projects.
